  <h2 class="mt-2">Presentation</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of this site is to showcase my
    <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code 2025</a>
    project. The entire site is static and built without JavaScript, using
    only client-side Python thanks to
    <a href="https://pyscript.net/">PyScript</a>. This framework allows
    Python code to be executed in the browser via
    <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly (WASM)</a>
    , offering an alternative to JavaScript. Each puzzle is therefore
    solved and displayed using Python executed locally in your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    An anti-spoiler tagging system allows you to navigate without the risk
    of inadvertently discovering solutions.
  </p>
  <p>Feel free to explore the different solutions on offer.</p>
  <p>
    Once the Advent of Code event is over (at which point I will have more
    time), I will work on optimising the website and providing
    explanations for each of the proposed solutions.
